Online-Compiler
===============

This is a web application where Off-Campus students of BITS Pilani could login with their credentials and use the C, C++, Java and Python compilers

Users could do two things:

* Write code online and compile it.
* Write codeline offline and submit it on this web interface for the compiler to show results.
